# PandOS Operating System

## Overview
PandOS is an educational operating system implementation for the UMPS3 architecture. This project implements a microkernel operating system with process management, synchronization, I/O handling, and exception management capabilities.

For a high level design discussion complete with diagrams see [TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md](TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md).

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Core Components

### Process Management
- **PCB:** Process Control Block implementation with functions for allocation, deallocation, and management of process queues and trees
- **Scheduler:** Two-level priority scheduler with high and low priority queues and round-robin time slicing

### Synchronization
- **ASL:** Active Semaphore List implementation for process synchronization
- **Semaphores:** Integer-based semaphore implementation with P (wait) and V (signal) operations

### Exception Handling
- **System Calls:** Eighteen system calls for process, I/O and memory services
- **Exception Dispatcher:** Handles various exceptions and routes them to appropriate handlers
- **Pass Up or Die:** Mechanism for handling unrecoverable exceptions

### Interrupt Handling
- **Device Interrupts:** Handles interrupts from various devices including disk, terminal, network, and printers
- **Timer Interrupts:** Manages processor local timer and interval timer events

## System Calls
1. **CREATEPROCESS (SYS1):** Create a new process
2. **TERMINATEPROCESS (SYS2):** Terminate a process and all its descendants
3. **PASSEREN (SYS3):** P operation on semaphore (blocking wait)
4. **VERHOGEN (SYS4):** V operation on semaphore (signal)
5. **WAITIO (SYS5):** Wait for I/O operation completion
6. **GETCPUTIME (SYS6):** Get CPU time used by current process
7. **WAITCLOCK (SYS7):** Wait for clock tick
8. **GETSUPPORTPTR (SYS8):** Get support structure pointer
9. **TERMINATE (SYS9):** Terminate the calling user process
10. **GET_TOD (SYS10):** Get the current time of day
11. **WRITEPRINTER (SYS11):** Write a string to the printer device
12. **WRITETERMINAL (SYS12):** Write a string to the terminal device
13. **READTERMINAL (SYS13):** Read a line from the terminal device
14. **DISK_PUT (SYS14):** Write a page to disk
15. **DISK_GET (SYS15):** Read a page from disk
16. **FLASH_PUT (SYS16):** Write a page to flash backing store
17. **FLASH_GET (SYS17):** Read a page from flash backing store
18. **DELAY (SYS18):** Sleep for a number of seconds

## Module Details

### Initial
The initialization module sets up the system data structures, Pass Up Vector for exceptions, and creates the first process running the test function.

### PCB
Implements a Process Control Block data structure and operations, including process queue management and parent-child relationships.

### ASL
Active Semaphore List manages semaphores and blocked processes, implementing operations to insert, remove, and search for processes blocked on semaphores.

### Scheduler
Implements a multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm with high and low priority queues, deadlock detection, and process loading.

### Exceptions
Handles all processor exceptions including system calls, TLB management, and program traps, implementing the "Pass Up or Die" philosophy.

### Interrupts
Handles all hardware interrupts including device I/O, processor local timer (PLT), and interval timer interrupts.

### SysSupport
Support level dispatcher for SYSCALLS 9â€“18. Provides printer and terminal I/O, disk and flash access, and delay services while validating user addresses.

### VmSupport
Pager and TLB refill handlers implementing a FIFO page replacement policy with a shared swap pool.

### Delay Daemon
Active Delay List management and SYS18 sleep service via a dedicated daemon process.

### InitProc
Creates user processes, initializes support structures, and waits for all children to terminate via a master semaphore.

## Time Management
- **CPU Accounting:** Tracks CPU time used by each process
- **Time Slicing:** Implements round-robin scheduling with fixed time quantum
- **Interval Timer:** Provides system clock ticks every 100ms
